> **Note**: This branch (master) contains a skeleton without any app code, perfect for creating a _new_ application or challenge. If you're looking for an example app built with this skeleton, take a look at the [example](/../..//tree/example) branch which includes basic CRUD and RSpec tests.

3. The user who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers to be the best answer.
4. Users can upvote and downvote questions, answers, and commentsâ€”only one vote per user for each question, answer, and comment.
5. Users cannot add a question, answer, or comment or vote unless they're logged in, but they can view all of the above when logged out.
- *Stretch*: Sort answers with the answer selected as the best answer first, followed by the most highly voted. Sort comments chronologically with oldest first.
- *Stretch*: Users can see questions sorted three ways: highest-voted, most recent, and "trending".

### Purpose
The Sinatra Skeleton:

1. Provides a foundation for building challenges or creating a new Sinatra application.
2. Demonstrates a reasonable set of practices around building Sinatra applications.

### Quickstart

1.  `bundle install`
2.  `shotgun config.ru`

As needed, create models & migrations with the `rake` tasks:

rake generate:model      # Create an empty model in app/models, e.g., rake generate:model NAME=User
```
